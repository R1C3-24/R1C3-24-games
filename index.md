Hello my name is Reece and I (with the help khaliq and waqeel) have created a 2-D, 2 player game using gamemaker studio 1.4. we created this during the BASH festival of code for 13-17 year olds. we were tasked with making a game, making music or presenting data in an interesting way.

Here is the finished product: Fast And Blocky Gobbs And Sean

please enjoy the game and remeber, we created this in a week and so it is very small and some features are not finished but we believed it was ready to be used as a finished demo.
